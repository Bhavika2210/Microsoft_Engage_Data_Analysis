-Dual airbags

-ABS

-Reverse parking sensors, as part of standard equipment.

# Why Random Forest Regressor
Random Forest regression performs better when the number of noise variables is more than the number of explanatory variables.
While Linear regression works better if the noise variables are lesser.
Using Random Forest Regressor: 92.44%
Using Cross Validation: 15 %
Using RandomizedSearchCV: Very Low
